RGAPepPipe
==========

Reference Guided Assembly Pepperell Lab Pipeline

This pipeline utilizes the HTCondor job management system. For more information: https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/

To Run Pipeline
==================

Create input file for pipeline containing run information:

Example:
```
ERR07108	ERS088906	ERX048850	illumina	paired
```
If fastqs will be downloaded, this step can be skipped. Create symbolic links of fastqs in submit directory. Paired end fastqs should end with _1.fastq and _2. fastq. 

Example snippet from IPython:
```
#uncompress files
g_zipped = !ls /opt/data/gvaginalis_g_vag_illumina_June-2016/*.fastq
for g in g_zipped:
	!gunzip {g}
â€‹
#create symbolic links
#note that the [6] below may need to be changed depending on how many directories are between your fastqs and /opt
files = !ls /opt/data/gvaginalis/g_vag_illumina_June-2016/*.fastq
for f in files:
    name = f.split("/")[6].split("_")[0]
    number = f.split("/")[6].split("_")[3][1]
    !ln -s {f} {name}_{number}.fastq
```

Use make_rga_dag.py to create DAG. DAG templates can be found in dagTemplates/. rga_dag.template is generally the most up to date with pipeline improvements. Edit the DAG template to run the programs you need (e.g. remove fastq-dump if fastqs are available locally).

Usage:
> make_rga_dag.py [-h] input reference dagtemplate

Copy all files from toRunPipeline/ to submit directory

Submit _toplevel.dag
> condor_submit_dag dag_file



Other Scripts
===================

enaFileParser.py
----------------
This script converts the text file downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive for a study and converts it into the input file for SRAtoVCF.py and a list of URLs of fastqs to be downloaded from ENA.

Usage:

> enaFileParser.py [input ENA text file]

get_url.py
---------
This script takes as input the ERPXXXXXX_download.txt file output by the enaFileParser.py and runs wget to download the fastq files. A '-t' flag allows the user to specify the number of threads.

FulltoSNP.py
------------
Takes the nexus file generated in SNPTableToNexus.py and performs a SNP alignment. Output file should be in .nex format. User must also input a threshold value (between 0 and 1) . The threshold determines the number of sequences with an ambiguous base at a certain position and rejects base position if the percentage of ambiguous bases is greater than the threshold.  
USAGE:

> FulltoSNP.py [input nexus file] [output file] [threshold value] 


Old Pipeline
===================

SRAtoVCF.py
------------
This script takes a list of SRA filenames (w/o .sra extension) and outputs a VCF file for each. For each sample, a tab-delimited .txt file is required containing:

> SRAReadGroupID	SampleGroupID	LibraryID	SeqPlatform	paired/single

For example:

> ERR07108	ERS088906	ERX048850	illumina	paired

The script must be run from a folder with downloaded .sra files. The path to the indexed reference .fa file must also be provided.

When running the script, type:
> python [path to SRAtoVCF.py] [path to .txt file] [.fasta reference file] [options]

For other available command line options run "python SRAtoVCF.py -h"



VCFsToSnpTable.py
-----------------

This script takes a variable number of input vcf files. Each .vcf file must contain snp information about only one strain. At least one input file must be supplied. The name of an output file must also be supplied, and output is in snp table format. The output contains the combined information about all strains. 

> VCFsToSnpTable.py [input .vcf 1] .... [input.vcf n] [output file]


SNPTableToNexus.py
-----------------

Takes the SnpTable generated in VCFsToSnpTable.py and converts it to a nexus file. Requires a reference genome as well. Output file should end in .nex.   

Usage:  

> SNPTableToNexus.py [input file] [outputfile] [reference sequence .fa file]


VCFtoFasta.py
-------------
This script takes a variable number of input vcf files. Each .vcf file must contain 'confident sites' about one strain. At least one input file must be supplied. The name of the output file(s) will be automatically generated from the sample name in the vcf (SRS or ERS number) plus the identifying information contained in the name of the input file (ideally the RGID). The script hwill produce a single contig (fasta format) with gaps ("-") at any site where there is no information in the VCF. The length and contig of the reference are infereed from the VCF header. 

> VCFtoFasta.py [input vcf file 1] .... [input vcf file n]

VCFtoContigs.py
-------------
This script takes a variable number of input vcf files. Each .vcf file must contain 'confident sites' about one strain. At least one input file must be supplied. The name of the output file(s) will be automatically generated from the sample name in the vcf (SRS or ERS number) plus the identifying information contained in the name of the input file (ideally the RGID). This script generates a multi-contig fasta, where each site with missing info starts a new contig. Further devolpment should address a minimum size of contigs to be output, how to deal with INDELS, and writing the output fasta with BioPython. THIS SCRIPT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED SINCE MODIFICATIONS WERE MADE - USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

> VCFtoContigs.py [input vcf file 1] .... [input vcf file n]


Example
--------


In the template directory lies all the reference genome files for M. tuberculosis (the H37Rv files). Also included is a text file ERP000132.txt These are two of the three things necessary in order to run SRAtoVCF.py. The third file is the SRA file which can be obtained from NCBI using the following command in the command line:

> wget -m ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByRun/sra/ERR/ERR027/ERR027082

This will create a folder of several sub directories in which ERR027082.sra is located. Move the .sra file to working directory. Then run the following command to execute SRAtoVCF.py:

> python SRAtoVCF.py ERP000132.txt H37Rv.fasta 

This will create a folder called ERP000132_vcf and within it will be a file ERR027082.vcf. You will use this file to run VCFtoSnpTable.py by running the command:

> python VCFsToSnpTable.py ERR027082.vcf SNPTable.txt

This will create a SNPTable.txt file which you will use to run SNPTableToNexus.py which is run with the following command:

> python SNPTableToNexus.py SNPTable.txt full.nex H37Rv.fasta

This will create full.nex which is the complete confident site nexus file. In order to get the SNP alignment nexus file run:

> python FulltoSNP.py full.nex end.nex .25

If all ran smoothly the end.nex file should match the final.nex file that is included in the template folder.
